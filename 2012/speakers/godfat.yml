summary: "By understanding various of ways to achieve concurrency (i.e. serving
more requests in a short period of time with less resource), we can
pick the right model which suits our needs for a certain kind of web
application and make it more responsive under high load/traffics and
less vulnerable to DoS attack.

There's no perfect one-and-for-all model, but only ones can suit our
need best. We'll talk about various ways for concurrency, and what's
current implementations which we can pick from and how to implement
them."
