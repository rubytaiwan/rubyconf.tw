## Subject

Writing custom DataMapper Adapters

## Extract

DataMapper is a storage engine agnostic ORM, it can work just as well with a RDMS as with any another type of storage engine such as, but not limited to: no sequel stores (redis, mongo...), XML or yaml data source, etc. While many adapters already exist to connect DataMapper to a miriad of storage engines, there may not be one for your preferred storage engine or you may need to communicate with data from a legacy system.     If this is the case I will introduce you to the clean and simple API used to write your custom DataMapper adapter.
