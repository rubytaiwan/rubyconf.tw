## Subject

A modular Ruby REST client collection/infrastructure

## Extract

In this era of web services and mashups, we have seen a blooming of REST
APIs. One might wonder, how do we use these APIs easily and elegantly?
Since REST is very simple compared to SOAP, it is not hard to build a
dedicated client ourselves.

We have developed [rest-core][] with composable middlewares to build a
REST client, based on the effort from [rest-graph][]. In the cases of
common APIs such as Facebook, Github, and Twitter, developers can simply
use the built-in dedicated clients provided by rest-core, or do it yourself
for any other REST APIs.
